# GAIA v1.3 â€” Week 1: Intro\n\nMinimal, clean intro page per spec:\n\n- White background, dark text\n- Centered **GAIA** wordmark at the largest reasonable size\n- No navbar\n- A **corner GAIA logo** exists globally but is hidden on the Intro (shows on other pages and links back home)\n- No external fonts; uses system stack for speed/stability\n- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\npnpm install   # or npm / yarn\npnpm dev       # http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n## Structure\n\n- `app/page.tsx`: Intro (just the big GAIA)\n- `components/TopLeftHome.tsx`: Fixed top-left "G / GAIA" that links to `/`, auto-hides on the Intro page\n- `components/Brand.tsx`: SVG monogram + wordmark\n- `app/globals.css`: Tailwind + small fade-in animation\n- `TRACE_UI-THEME.md`: running trace of theme-related references\n\n## Next steps (Week 2+)\n- Add routes like `/gallery`, `/apollo`, etc. The corner logo will appear automatically and route back to `/`.\n- The Intro will list component links as they are completed (not implemented in Week 1 by design).\n
