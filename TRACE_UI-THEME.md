# TRACE_UI-THEME.md — GAIA v1.3

> Auto-maintained log of theme-related imports/usages (per user's project rule).

**2025-10-23** — Week 1 (Intro)
- `/app/globals.css` — Tailwind directives plus root height helpers; no custom classes.
- `/components/TopLeftHome.tsx` — Floating GAIA badge now built with Tailwind utilities (no global `.corner`).
- No external theme libraries. No `data-theme` attributes yet.
